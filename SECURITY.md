## Security Measures

This project employs the following security practices:

- **Dependency auditing**: Uses `cargo-deny` to check for known vulnerabilities and license compliance
- **Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)**: Ensures compatibility with Rust 1.70+ which includes important security fixes
- **Continuous Integration**: All changes are tested across multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates to stay current with security patches
